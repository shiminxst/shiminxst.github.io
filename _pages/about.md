I joined the School of Computing & Informatics, University of Louisiana at Lafayette as an Assistant Professor in 2024. I earned my Ph.D. from Florida Atlantic University under the guidance of Professors Yufei Tang and Xingquan Zhu in 2020. I completed postdoctoral training at Washington University in St. Louis in March 2022, and at Harvard University in August 2024.

- **Research Internship Opportunities**:
    * **If you are currently at UCSD**: I only take students who (1) have a clear research problem/objective and some initial ideas; (2) have relevant research experiences or have strong background in math/stats/physics; and (3) could devote enough time on research. Please highlight these in your email including a time plan.
    * **If you are not at UCSD** (e.g., Summer Internship): Visitors are mostly recommended by my collaborators and have their own funding support. The minimum duration of stay at UCSD is 12 weeks (preferably 6 months - 1 year). Please indicate the time range in your email.

**In your email**, please include the following items:
- Title as "Prospective Student: YourName - YourAffliation"
- Briefly introduce what research problem that you are interested in. What are the current state-of-the-art solutions and why do you think you can further improve over them?
- Briefly introduce yourself, including education background, research experiences, and programming skills.
