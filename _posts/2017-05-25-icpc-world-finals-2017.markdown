ACM-ICPC World Finals 2017 is held in Rapid City, South Dakota. Starting from the Uber to the airport, it seems to me that most of, if not all, American people rarely heard about this city. After this trip, now, I have a better understanding about the phrase "the middle of nowhere". Anyway, it's still a wonderful trip, because of many old friends and interesting board games.

Our team, Yewen Fan, Tong Li, and Yuting Zhang, has solved 4 problems and finally ranked at 56th place out of 128 teams.
