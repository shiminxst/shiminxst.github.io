## Week 1: Practicing the Art of Data Science {#week1}

### Abstract

Data science embraces interdisciplinary methodologies and tools, such as those in statistics, artificial intelligence/machine learning, data management, algorithms, computation and economics. Practicing data science to empower innovative applications, however, remains an art due to many factors beyond technology, such as sophistication of application scenarios, business demands, and the central role of human being in the loop. In this talk, I share with the audience some experience and lessons I learned from my practice of data science research and development. First, I illustrate the core value of building domain-oriented, end-to-end data science solutions that can help people gain new interpretable domain knowledge. Second, using network embedding as an example, I demonstrate that the nature of data science practice is to connect challenges in vertical applications with general scientific principles and tools. I also discuss some future directions, particularly about data strategies for enterprises and organizations on data as assets, privacy, fairness, accountability, and transparency.

## Week 2: Learning with all experiences: A standardized ML formalism {#week2}

### Abstract

In handling a wide range of experiences ranging from data instances, knowledge, constraints, to rewards, adversaries, and lifelong interplay in an ever-growing spectrum of tasks, contemporary ML/AI research has resulted in a large multitude of learning paradigms (e.g., supervised, unsupervised, active, reinforcement, adversarial learning), models, optimization algorithms, etc. While pushing the field forward rapidly, these results also make a comprehensive grasp of existing ML techniques more and more difficult, and make standardized, reusable, repeatable, and reliable practice and further development of ML/AI products quite costly, if possible at all. In this talk, I’ll present a standardized formalism of machine learning that provides a unified mathematical framework for learning with all experiences. The formalism offers a vehicle for understanding, unifying, and generalizing current major paradigms of learning algorithms, and guidance of operationalizing ML for creating problem solutions in a composable and mechanic manner. I’ll show its applications in controllable text generation, learning with structured knowledge, automated data manipulation, stabilizing GAN training, etc.

## Week 3: Physics-Guided AI for Learning Spatiotemporal Dynamics {#week3}

### Abstract

Applications such as public health, transportation, climate science, and aerospace engineering require learning complex dynamics from large-scale spatiotemporal data. Such data is often non-linear, non-Euclidean, high-dimensional, and demonstrates complicated dependencies. Existing machine learning frameworks are still insufficient to learn spatiotemporal dynamics as they often fail to exploit the underlying physics principles. I will demonstrate how to inject physical knowledge in AI to deal with these challenges. I will showcase the application of these methods to problems such as forecasting COVID-19, self-driving car trajectory modeling, and predicting turbulence and ocean currents.

## Week 4: Fine-Tuning of Pretrained Language Models under Limited or Weak Supervision {#week4}

### Abstract

Transfer learning has fundamentally changed the landscape of natural language processing (NLP). Many state-of-the-art models are first pre-trained on a large text corpus and then fine-tuned on downstream tasks. When we only have limited and weak supervision for the downstream tasks, however, due to the extremely high complexity of pre-trained models, aggressive fine-tuning often causes the fine-tuned model to overfit the training data of downstream tasks and fail to generalize to unseen data.

To address such a concern, we propose a new approach for fine-tuning of pretrained models to attain better generalization performance. Our proposed approach adopts three important ingredients: (1) Smoothness-inducing regularization, which effectively manages the complexity of the massive model; (2) Bregman proximal point optimization, which is an instance of trust-region methods and can prevent aggressive updating; (3) Self-training, which can gradually improve the model fitting and effectively suppress error propagation. Our experiments show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms existing methods in multiple NLP tasks under limited or weak supervision.

## Week 5: Learning to see the physical world {#week5}

### Abstract

Human intelligence is beyond pattern recognition. From a single image, we're able to explain what we see, reconstruct the scene in 3D, predict what's going to happen, and plan our actions accordingly. In this talk, I will present our recent work on physical scene understanding---building versatile, data-efficient, and generalizable machines that learn to see, reason about, and interact with the physical world. The core idea is to exploit the generic, causal structure behind the world, including knowledge from computer graphics, physics, and language, in the form of approximate simulation engines, and to integrate them with deep learning. Here, deep learning plays two major roles: first, it learns to invert simulation engines for efficient inference; second, it learns to augment simulation engines for constructing powerful forward models. I'll focus on a few topics to demonstrate this idea: building scene representation for both object geometry and physics; learning expressive dynamics models for planning and control; perception and reasoning beyond vision.

## Week 6: Privacy and Machine Learning in Biomedical Applications {#week6}

### Abstract

Current health information systems enable the collection of a variety of data (e.g., genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors) that hold great opportunities for advancing medical research and improving patient care (e.g., GWAS). However, there are significant privacy concerns for sharing these data and enabling data-driven applications (e.g., machine learning), as violations can have consequences (e.g., discrimination). In this talk, I will provide an overview of the differential privacy model, which allows a trusted data aggregator (e.g., hospital) to shared data with rigorous privacy guarantee. Specifically, I will present how the differential privacy model can enable privacy-protecting machine learning tasks and showcase an application for survival analyses.

## Week 7: Using AI to Enable Digital Medicine {#week7}

### Abstract

Digitalize human beings using biosensors to track our complex physiologic system, process the large amount of data generated with artificial intelligence (AI) and change clinical practice towards individualized medicine: these are the goals of digital medicine. In this talk, we discuss how to design AI solutions in the clinical space and what are the key aspects to make a difference. We focus on two critical clinical topics that need AI: 1) atrial fibrillation (AF), and 2) viral illnesses (COVID-19). AF is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia, associated with stroke, heart failure and coronary artery disease. AF detection from single-lead electrocardiography (ECG) recordings is still an open problem, as AF events may be episodic and the signal noisy. We conduct a thoughtful analysis of recent convolutional neural network architectures developed in the computer vision field, redesigned to be suitable for a one-dimensional signal, and we evaluate their performance in the detection of AF using 200 thousand seconds of ECG, highlighting the potential and pitfall of this technology. We also discuss how to explain (global and local post hoc explanations) this AI model for AF detection using features that are commonly used by a cardiologist. 

To tackle the problem of COVID-19, we start with an overview of continuous, passively monitored vital signs from 200,000 individuals wearing a Fitbit wearable device for 2 years. This large study provides the baseline for DETECT, our app-based, nationwide clinical study enrolling individuals who routinely use a smartwatch or other wireless devices to determine if individualized tracking of changes in heart rate, activity and sleep can provide early diagnosis and self-monitoring for COVID-19. We analyze data from more than 36,000 individuals, showing how we can discriminate (on an individual level) between COVID-19 and other types of infections. We discuss how this can impact both the individual and public health, and how the use of AI can be a game changer in this fight against the virus.

## Week 8: Compressing Variational Bayes {#week8}

### Abstract

Neural image compression algorithms have recently outperformed their classical counterparts in rate-distortion performance and show great potential to also revolutionize video coding. In this talk, I will show how recent innovations from approximate Bayesian inference and generative modeling can lead to dramatic performance improvements in compression. In particular, I will explain how sequential variational autoencoders can be converted into video codecs, how deep latent variable models can be compressed in post-processing with variable bitrates, and how iterative amortized inference can be used to achieve the world record in image compression performance.

## Week 10: Causal Inference for Responsible Data Science {#week10}

### Abstract

Scaling and democratizing access to big data promises to provide meaningful, actionable information that supports decision-making. Today, data-driven decisions profoundly affect the course of our lives, such as whether to admit applicants to a particular school, offer them a job, or grant them a mortgage. Unfair, inconsistent, or faulty decision-making raises serious concerns about ethics and responsibility. For example, we may know that our training data is biased, but how do we avoid propagating discrimination when we use this data?  How do we avoid incorrect, spurious and non-reproducible findings?  How can we curate and expose existing data to make it "safe" for informed decision-making?   

In this talk, I describe how we can combine techniques from causal inference and data management to develop systems and algorithms that help answer some of these questions.  Many existing popular notions of fairness in ML fail to distinguish between discriminatory, non-discriminatory and spurious correlations between sensitive attributes and outcomes of learning algorithms. I present a new notion of fairness that subsumes and improves upon previous definitions and correctly distinguishes between fairness violations and non-violations. Further, I describe an approach to removing discrimination by repairing training data in order to remove the effects of any inappropriate and/or discriminatory causal relationships between a protected attribute and classifier predictions.  Finally, I present my most recent work that use counterfactual reasoning and provenance for explaining black-box decision-making algorithms.
