Online Lecturing
======

Due to the COVID-19, this course will be delivered over Zoom: [https://ucsd.zoom.us/j/93540989128](https://ucsd.zoom.us/j/93540989128)

Overview
======

This course mainly focuses on introducing machine learning methods and models that are useful in analyzing real-world data. It will cover classical regression & classification models, clustering methods, and deep neural networks. No previous background in machine learning is required, but all participants should be comfortable with programming, and with basic optimization and linear algebra. 

There is no textbook required, but here are some recommended readings:
- [The Elements of Statistical Learning](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/printings/ESLII_print12.pdf) by Trevor Hastie, â€ŽRobert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman.
- [Data Mining: Concepts and Techniques](https://books.google.com/books/about/Data_Mining_Concepts_and_Techniques.html?id=pQws07tdpjoC&source=kp_book_description) by Jiawei Han et al.
- [Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning](https://books.google.com/books/about/Pattern_Recognition_and_Machine_Learning.html?id=HL4HrgEACAAJ&source=kp_book_description) by Christopher M. Bishop.
- [Dive into Deep Learning](https://d2l.ai/) book by Aston Zhang et al.

Prerequisites
======

1. Ability to code in Python: functions, control structures, string handling, arrays and dictionaries.

2. Familiarity with basic probability, at the level of CSE 21 or CSE 103.

3. Familiarity with basic linear algebra, at the level of Math 18 or Math 20F.
