Online Lecturing
======

Due to the COVID-19 Omicron Variant, in the first two weeks, this course will be delivered over Zoom: [https://ucsd.zoom.us/j/97017584161](https://ucsd.zoom.us/j/97017584161)


Overview
======

This course mainly focuses on introducing current methods and models that are useful in analyzing and mining real-world data. It will cover frequent pattern mining, regression & classification, clustering, and representation learning. No previous background in machine learning is required, but all participants should be comfortable with programming, and with basic optimization and linear algebra. 

There is no textbook required, but here are some recommended readings:
- The classical data mining textbook "[Data Mining: Concepts and Techniques](https://books.google.com/books/about/Data_Mining_Concepts_and_Techniques.html?id=pQws07tdpjoC&source=kp_book_description)" by Jiawei Han et al.
- The classical data mining/machine learning book "[Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning](https://books.google.com/books/about/Pattern_Recognition_and_Machine_Learning.html?id=HL4HrgEACAAJ&source=kp_book_description)" by Christopher M. Bishop
- The new "[Dive into Deep Learning](https://d2l.ai/)" book by Aston Zhang et al.

Project (25%)
======

Instructions for both choices will be available [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/aqkk6q6hjtpzwbq/Project%20Instructions.pdf?dl=0). Project ****due on Sunday, Mar 13 EOD****.

Here is a quick overview:
- **Choice 1: Team-Based Open-Ended Project**
    - 1 to 4 members per team. More members, higher expectation.
    - Define your own research problem and justify its importance
    - Come up with your hypothesis and find some datasets for verification
    - Design your own models or try a large variety of existing models
    - Write a 4 to 8 pages report (research-paper like)
    - Submit your codes
    - Up to 5% bonus for working demos/apps towards the total course grade.
- **Choice 2: Individual-Based Deep Dive into Data Mining Methods**
    - Implement a few models learned from this course from scratch.
    - Skeleton codes can be found [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/y5a5wvrysbl7mrd/AAARcWGHjlWRN9E-6B9H3KFCa?dl=0). Your work is more like "filling in blanks" following the TODOs outlined in the Jupyter-Notebook.
    - Each model has a point associated with it. 6 points required. Points for each model is available at the end of the instruction slides.
    - Write a report (pages based on points) describing your interesting findings.
    - Up to 5% bonus towards the total course grade. Roughly 1 point, 1%.
