Online Lecturing
======

To offer waitlist students opportunities to learn more about this course, in the first week, we deliver the lecture over Zoom: [https://ucsd.zoom.us/j/95861287987](https://ucsd.zoom.us/j/95861287987). The lecture will be recorded. 


Overview
======

This course mainly focuses on introducing current methods and models that are useful in analyzing and mining real-world unstructured text data.

As the starting points, we will review basic machine learning models like linear regression and logistic regression. Then, we will cover traditional text preprocessing techniques, including tokenization, POS tagging, parsing, etc, using popular Python libraries as examples. After that, we will talk about more text analysis problems like text classification (e.g., sentiment analysis), information retrieval, topic modeling, word embedding, language models, etc. 

This course will mainly focus on high-level understandings of these concepts and also provide the students handles to implement their own text analysis models (e.g., how to use 3rd-party libs, and how to set hyper-parameters).

After the midterm exam, we will take about more advanced text mining problems, such as phrase mining, named entity recognition, and taxonomy construction. We will go beyond the traditional supervised methods and put some emphasis on unsupervised, weakly supervised, and distantly supervised methods.
Bootstrapping, comparative analysis, learning from seed words and existing knowledge bases will be the key methodologies to know.

We will have a take-home midterm, a few homework assignments, a Kaggle-like competition, and a final (team-based) project. These four parts will have roughly the same weights.

There is no textbook required, but there are recommended readings for each lecture (at the end of the slides).

If you don't have much experience in data mining, machine learning, etc. Here are some recommended textbooks to review.

- The classical data mining textbook "[Data Mining: Concepts and Techniques](https://books.google.com/books/about/Data_Mining_Concepts_and_Techniques.html?id=pQws07tdpjoC&source=kp_book_description)" by Jiawei Han et al.
- The classical data mining/machine learning book "[Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning](https://books.google.com/books/about/Pattern_Recognition_and_Machine_Learning.html?id=HL4HrgEACAAJ&source=kp_book_description)" by Christopher M. Bishop
- The new "[Dive into Deep Learning](https://d2l.ai/)" book by Aston Zhang et al.


Prerequisites
======
