**Class Time**: Mondays and Wednesday, 2:30PM to 3:45PM.  **Room**: James R. Oliver, Room 119A.

## Overview
This course primarily concentrates on introducing contemporary methods and models essential for analyzing and mining real-world data. Students will gain hands-on experience in various key topics such as big data analysis, classification, clustering, association rule mining, and representation learning. 

## Learning Objectives
- Understand basic concepts and techniques of data mining.
- Perform data preprocessing such as data cleaning, normalization, transformation, and dimensionality reduction.
- Analyze data using various supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms.
- Apply state-of-the-art data mining technology to real-world applications.
