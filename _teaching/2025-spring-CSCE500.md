**Class Time**: Mondays and Wednesdays, 10:00AM to 11:15AM.  
**Room**: James R. Oliver, Room 113.

Overview
======

This course introduces basic elements of the design and analysis of algorithms. Topics include asymptotic notations and analysis, divide and conquer, greedy algorithms, dynamic programming, fundamental graph algorithms, and NP-completeness. Students will gain hands-on experience to design and analyze algorithms for solving problems.

Learning Objectives
======

- Study common data structures and algorithms.
- Understand the design principles and efficiencies of various algorithms.
- Gain hands-on experiences to design algorithms to solve practical problems.

Prerequisites
======

CMPS 341 and 406
